Welcome to the Alaffia DevOps Engineer Challenge!

In this challenge you are going to be assessed on your ability to stand-up infrastructure, build pipelines, and deploy containers by using the most efficient and automated means possible with the help of a wide range of tooling.

This repo contains a very simple API, written in Node, that will serve as the deployment guineau pig for your challenge.

The API serves up (2) routes:

/private - returns a JSON object that contains a hardcarded fact about dogs (who doesn't love dogs :))

/public - performs a fetch to an external API that serves up a random fact about dogs and returns a JSON object with the fact inside. Each time you hit this endpoint the fact changes.
